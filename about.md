Hi there and thanks for visiting my page and learning a little about me ^___^.
I am currently attending Hack Reactor in my efforts to become a full stack developer and JavaScript ninja.

I am an attorney and received my J.D. from Florida State University, School of Law.  
I also have a B.A. in philosophy from Rutgers University, New Brunswick. 


### More Information

I'm originally from the NYC area, and spent my formative years there. I also lived in Florida for 6 years - three spent studying at FSU Law, and three spent practicing in South Florida. Now I'm in San Francisco hoping to live the tech dream with all the magnificent people of the Bay Area.
