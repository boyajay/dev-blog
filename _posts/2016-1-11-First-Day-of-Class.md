title: First Day of Hack Reactor
---

So I'm finally done moving to San Francisco and I loving it - the city is invigorating. I went from sitting hours in traffic everyday to walking and skating everywhere. Mostly everyone is socially and environmentally conscious. And I started Hack Reactor today!

### What is Hack Reactor like?

Well I can only give first impressions, but I can honestly say I was kind of blown away by how positive the first impression has been. One thing that I was worried about was the growing cohort size and possible growing pains as Hack Reactor has been scaling bigger. Instead, the larger group of intelligent people meant quite a diversity of interesting people from around the world. As it is now, the facility is bustling and there's a bit of a bottleneck when all the students change floors for lectures and pair programming, but the equipment and space is perfectly able to accomodate hacking. Pair programming is done on single imac with a pair of mice and keyboards and a pair of 28" Samsung monitors. The lectures didn't feel too big with the two cohorts attending together - it still retains a cozy, intimate setting and everyone has ample opportunity to speak. The daily calendar for the first half of the course is fully loaded with events, such as toy problems, lectures, pair programming, guest speakers, and social events. The second half of the courses includes portfolio building and promises structured job search training and assistance. The two lecturers who gave talks today were both phenomenal and charismatic, and people I look forward to learning from. And they provide breakfast in the mornings so that's pretty sweet too. I really like what I'm seeing.

### Pre-Course Week and HR Week 1 

The pre-course work was pretty substantial, and covered a wide range of topics. It is designed to prepare the student to be ready to hit the ground running at HR, and required some time and thought to get through. Some of the topics included:  

*  version control and using GitHub
*  debugging techniques and using dev tools
*  html/css and javascript basics
*  scopes and closures
*  introductory to jQuery
*  functions with recursion and mutual recursion

There was also several exercises that involved recreating functions from other JavaScript libraries. Some of the curriculum from the first week will be reviewing the pre-course work and getting accustomed to pair programming. There's a great emphasis on mastering callback functions and recursion, which I believe will come in handy when we get to learning Node.js as that is heavy on using callbacks. There's a lot more that's on the Week 1 syllabus, and I'll try post about anything particularly interesting at the end of the week.
